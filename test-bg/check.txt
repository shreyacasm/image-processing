through dir: Automatic Noise Reduction and Sharpening

The full auto mode automatically removes digital noise while preserving and enhancing text
detail and edges. Several pre-defined presets and manual adjustments are available to fine-
tune the performance.

This feature is based on the powerful noise reduction engine used in STOIK Noise AutoFix, and
adapted to document images. Specific algorithms are included for certain image capturing
devices such as Nokia smartphones and iPhone 4.

Brightness Equalization

Brightness equalization automatically reduces brightness variations throughout the document
by making dark (e.g. printed text) and bright (e.g. white paper) areas appear equally lit even in
mixed lighting conditions such as shots taken in the library. Brightness equalization can
enhance visual quality of images appearing in the document.



Brightness and Contrast Correction

Brightness and contrast enhancement automatically corrects document brightness and contrast
to provide the best image quality. Manual adjustment is an option.

ements such as
texture, dots, lines, as well photocopying and scanning artefacts common in documents such as
ID cards and passports, bank checks, tickets, and so on.

Cleaning background before processing the document with an OCR program can dramatically
increase text recognition quality. As an example, there was an almost 50% increase in text
recognition quality in a part of a security suite that was capturing passport information.

Whitening document background

Whitening document background is yet another mean to reduce document size and improve
text legibility in scanned documents. The function makes the whole document background
white while presenting text characters in black, even if inverse fonts (bright text on dark
background) or light colors were originally used.

The function can be adjusted for different strength and character sizes. The featur
handy when faxing or printing complex documents, as it extends cartridge life and lead
significant reduction of transmission time and costs.
